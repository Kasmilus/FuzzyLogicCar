# FuzzyLogicCar
#### Car driver AI using Fuzzy Inference System - made with Unity and AForge Fuzzy Logic library.

## Demo
[**YouTube Video**](https://youtu.be/kHhF-OkGDxY)

## Description
Application implements basic FIS to control two cars - steering them to the centre of the road based on input distance and velocity. Two cars presented are using slightly modified FIS to simulate different driver behaviour.

It was built quickly in just 2 days so it's rather basic but demonstrates how fuzzy logic could be a powerful tool in AI programming.

## Code
FIS is defined in *CarInferenceSystem.cs* and car movement in *CarMovement.cs*.
